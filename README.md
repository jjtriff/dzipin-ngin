d for data, zipin for compressing, ngin for engine. Data compression solution

## the problem

I live in Cuba with a (very) expensive, very limited bandwidth and data allowance.

## the (spected) solution

A sort of container, deployable on the cloud that would do things like compressing 
generic traffic and do optimizations on both HTTP and HTTPS.

Is probably a mix of technologies like SSH, OpenVPN, some opensource Proxy.
